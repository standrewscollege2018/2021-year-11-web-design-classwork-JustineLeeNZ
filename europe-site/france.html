    <h1>France</h1>


    <p>France in the middle of one of its hottest summers on record when we visited
    </p>
    <p>We spent time at the beach in Normandy as well as enjoying plenty of shaded cafes!
    </p>

    <h2>Mont St Michel</h2>
    <img src="images/montstmichel.jpg" alt="Mont St Michel">
    <p>This famous old monastery is situated on an island and stands out prominently for miles around.
    </p>
    <p>Narrow streets and thousands of tourists made for an overwhelming visit.
